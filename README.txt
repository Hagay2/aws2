Project 2 - Analyzing IMDB Datasets

------------------------------

background:

This project started with provisioning a Spark Cluster on AWS EMR and then connecting it to Jupyter Notebook in order to running my analysis.
This analysis based on the IMDB's datasets from Kaggle, these datasets include 4 datasets: actors, genres, movie actors and movie rating.

--------------------------------

The analysis:

The analysis has 4 parts:
PART 1 - Installation and Initial Setup: under this part, I will install the relevant libraries and load the datasets.
PART 2 - Analyzing Genres: under this part, I will answer questions related to the genres dataset.
PART 3 - Analyzing Job Categories: At this part I will present result for questions related to job category.
PART 4 - Here I will answer unique questions regarding all the datasets.
Extra credit: At this part, I picked the second option and created a new dataset that list all the actros/actress who died at the last 10 years.

----------------------------------

Conclusion:

This analysis was very interesting for as I got to know new details about movies that I didn't know before.
More improtant is the fact that my skills in Python, SQL and the AWS platforms have improved significantly.
My main challange was dealing with the Jupiter Notebook as it collapsed a couple of times due to overload, which caused me to rerun the program over and over.
